# RenPy ThemeLoader
This is a modded version of RenPy that let's you import themes into the "themes" folder and load them in renpy.

# Installation
This has a very simple installation. Just download the current version of renpy at https://www.renpy.org/latest.html and drag all these files into the "game" folder(located inside the launcher folder). Then, create a folder in the base directory(the one with the exe) and name it "themes". All of that should work fine. Report bugs to this github if anything breaks.
